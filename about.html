  <div class="col-sm-12"> During my preteen years I discovered my passion for music, I sing, write, compose and play the bass guitar. At high school, I studied music and arts and after graduation went straight to the military where I served in the army band as a singer. Besides the great role which music plays in my life, also organization and production have always played a side. Since I remember myself I would organize events and parties for my friends. Everyone called me “the producer”. One day I was sitting with a friend telling him how I feel and that's when he gave me the idea of studying abroad. CB feels perfect for me. Learning about the many fields of media, how to be a great manager and how to work on projects. I feel that I can develop myself so much in these studies and become a professional manager and media expert. My goal for these studies is to graduate when I know everything about how to manage and market my business, and finally - to sit on the top of my big successful record label.</div>
